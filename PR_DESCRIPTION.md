# Bug Fixes: Theme Toggle, Login Documentation, and Radar API

## Summary
This PR fixes three critical bugs affecting the weather application:
1. **Removed unwanted theme toggle** from navigation
2. **Documented login setup** for local development
3. **Fixed weather radar API key** lookup issue

## Changes

### üé® Theme Toggle Removal
**File:** `components/navigation.tsx`

- Removed moon/sun theme toggle button from navigation bar
- Theme changes should now only be done via Profile/Dashboard settings page
- Provides clearer UX: users configure themes in settings, not via quick-toggle

**Why:** The toggle was confusing users and conflicted with the theme persistence system.

---

### üîê Login/Authentication Documentation
**Files Created:**
- `LOGIN_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup guide for Supabase authentication
- `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Investigation report with troubleshooting

**Key Points:**
- Login works in **production** (Vercel has the credentials)
- Local development requires `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
- Comprehensive guide with step-by-step setup instructions
- OAuth provider configuration documented

**Production Impact:** ‚úÖ None - login already works in production via Vercel environment variables

### üó∫Ô∏è Weather Radar API Key Fix
**Files:**
- `app/api/weather/radar/[layer]/[...tile]/route.ts` - Fixed API key lookup
- `RADAR_INVESTIGATION.md` - Investigation documentation

**The Bug:**
```typescript
// Before (broken):
const apiKey = process.env.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY  // ‚ùå Not found in Vercel

// After (fixed):
const apiKey = process.env.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY  // ‚úÖ Works!
```

**Impact:**
- Weather radar was likely returning 500 errors in production
- Now correctly checks both server-side and client-side env variable names
- Added better error logging for debugging

---

## Testing

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [ ] Verify Vercel env vars include `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
- [ ] Test weather radar loads on production deployment
- [ ] Test login flow on production deployment
- [ ] Verify theme toggle is removed from navigation

### Expected Behavior After Merge
- ‚úÖ Navigation bar shows auth button only (no theme toggle)
- ‚úÖ Weather radar tiles load correctly on map
- ‚úÖ Login/signup works in production
- ‚úÖ Local development has clear setup instructions
