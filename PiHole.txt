es, that is exactly the right plan.

Here is the "Order of Operations" so you don't get locked out during the process:

Phase 1: The Reset & Login
Perform the Reset: Hold that WPS button for 60 seconds until the lights change. Wait ~10 minutes for it to come back up.

Connect to the "Sticker" WiFi: Your computer will not see "kubeds" anymore. You must connect to XFSETUP-27B1 using password direct9703elbow.

Login: Open a browser, go to http://10.0.0.1, and use admin / password.

Phase 2: Make Your Life Easier (WiFi Name)
Before you mess with Pi-hole settings, put your old WiFi name back so all your house devices (TVs, phones, thermostats) reconnect automatically.

In the 10.0.0.1 menu: Find Connection > Wi-Fi.

Change the Name (SSID) back to kubeds.

Change the Password back to your old password.

Save.

Your computer will disconnect. Reconnect to "kubeds" with your normal password.

Phase 3: The Pi-hole Setup (The "DHCP Swap")
Now that you are back on your normal network, we need to force the router to use Pi-hole. Since Comcast locks the DNS setting, you have to disable DHCP on the router and enable it on the Pi-hole.

1. Prepare the Pi-hole:

Go to http://<YOUR_PI_IP>/admin.

Go to Settings > DHCP.

Check "DHCP server enabled".

Scroll down and Save.

2. Disable Router DHCP:

Go back to http://10.0.0.1.

Go to Connection > Local IP Network.

Uncheck "Enable DHCP Server" (IPv4).

Save.

3. Reboot the Router:

Unplug the router power, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in.

When it comes back up, it will stop handing out IP addresses, and your Pi-hole will take over, forcing every device to block ads.
