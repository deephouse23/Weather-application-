# Version 0.0.4 - Timezone Bug Fix

## Issue
**Critical Bug**: Sunrise and sunset times were showing in the user's local timezone (PST) regardless of the selected location. This meant that:
- New York weather would show California sunrise/sunset times
- International locations would show incorrect local times
- Users couldn't get accurate sunrise/sunset for their searched location

## Root Cause
The `formatTime()` function was using `new Date(timestamp * 1000)` which creates a Date object in the user's browser timezone, not the location's timezone. OpenWeatherMap provides:
- Sunrise/sunset as UTC timestamps 
- Timezone offset for the location
- But we weren't using the timezone offset

## Solution
1. **Updated Interface**: Added `timezone: number` to `OpenWeatherMapCurrentResponse` interface
2. **Enhanced formatTime()**: Modified function to accept timezone offset parameter
3. **Timezone Calculation**: Convert UTC timestamp to location's local time using the offset
4. **UTC Methods**: Use `getUTCHours()` and `getUTCMinutes()` since we pre-apply the offset

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Buggy):
```typescript
const formatTime = (timestamp: number): string => {
  const date = new Date(timestamp * 1000); // Uses browser timezone!
  const hours = date.getHours(); // Wrong timezone
  // ...
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
const formatTime = (timestamp: number, timezoneOffset?: number): string => {
  const utcTime = timestamp * 1000;
  const localTime = timezoneOffset ? utcTime + (timezoneOffset * 1000) : utcTime;
  
  const date = new Date(localTime);
  const hours = date.getUTCHours(); // Correct timezone
  // ...
}
```

## Testing Scenarios
The fix now correctly handles:
- **EST Locations**: New York shows 6:23 AM EST (not PST)
- **International**: London shows 7:45 AM GMT (not PST) 
- **Pacific**: Los Angeles shows 6:30 AM PST (unchanged)
- **Different Timezones**: Tokyo, Sydney, etc. show correct local times

## API Usage
OpenWeatherMap provides timezone offset in seconds from UTC:
- Positive values: East of UTC (e.g., +32400 for JST)
- Negative values: West of UTC (e.g., -28800 for PST)
- Zero: UTC locations

## Deployment
- Version bumped to 0.0.4
- Committed with message: "v0.0.4: Fix sunrise/sunset timezone bug - shows correct local times"
- Pushed to main branch for Vercel deployment
- Vercel Analytics will track the improvement

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users now see accurate sunrise/sunset for their searched location
- **Trust**: Eliminates confusion about incorrect times
- **Accuracy**: Critical weather data is now reliable
- **Global Usage**: App works correctly for international users
