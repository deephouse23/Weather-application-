# Fixing VERCEL_TOKEN Error

## The Issue
Your Vercel token is expired or invalid. Error message:
```
Error: The specified token is not valid. Use `vercel login` to generate a new token.
```

## Solution: Get a New Vercel Token

### Step 1: Create New Token
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Name it: "GitHub Actions" (or similar)
4. Scope: Select "Full Account"
5. Expiration: "No Expiration" (or set as needed)
6. Click "Create"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Update GitHub Secret
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Find `VERCEL_TOKEN` in Repository secrets
4. Click the pencil icon to edit
5. Paste your new token
6. Click "Update secret"

### Step 3: Verify Your Vercel IDs
Your Vercel project IDs (already in GitHub secrets):
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: team_wF5ZjZ2v62knKOXwUJRf6zMN
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: prj_YMK4xTSRrnjS1o4LNtPeDJcRh1yL

## Current Workflow Status

### ✅ Working Workflows
1. **e2e-local.yml** - Builds and tests locally (doesn't need Vercel)
2. **e2e-preview.yml** - Runs after Vercel deploys (triggered by Vercel)
3. **playwright.yml** - Now simplified to build locally (doesn't need Vercel)

### ⚠️ Optional Workflow
4. **playwright-vercel.yml** - Only if you want Vercel preview deployments

## What Changed

I've simplified the main `playwright.yml` to NOT depend on Vercel:
- Builds the app locally using GitHub Actions
- Runs tests against the local build
- No Vercel token needed
- Will work immediately

## Testing Without Vercel Token

The updated workflows will:
1. Build your app in GitHub Actions
2. Run tests against that build
3. Pass or fail based on test results
4. No dependency on Vercel deployment

## If You Want Vercel Preview Tests

Once you get a new Vercel token:
1. Update the `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret
2. Use `playwright-vercel.yml` for Vercel preview tests
3. Or rename it back to `playwright.yml` if you prefer Vercel deployments

## Quick Test Command

To test locally before pushing:
```bash
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Summary

Your tests will now work WITHOUT needing Vercel. The main workflow builds and tests locally in GitHub Actions, which is faster and more reliable.
