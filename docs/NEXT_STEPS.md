# Next Steps - Authentication Fix

## Quick Start

Your authentication issues have been fixed! Here's what to do next:

---

## 1. Test Locally (5 minutes)

### Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test the following:

#### A. Email/Password Authentication
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Sign in with an existing account
3. âœ… Should redirect to homepage within 1 second
4. âœ… Should see your user avatar in the top-right

#### B. Google OAuth
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. âœ… Should see branded callback page with 16-Bit Weather logo
4. âœ… Should redirect to homepage within 2-3 seconds
5. âœ… Should see logged-in state

#### C. Sign Up Flow
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Create a new account
3. âœ… Should show success message about email verification

---

## 2. Configure Google OAuth Branding (15-30 minutes)

**This is IMPORTANT to fix the "string of keys" issue!**

### Follow the detailed guide:
ðŸ“– **[docs/OAUTH_SETUP.md](./OAUTH_SETUP.md)**

### Quick Summary:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Select your project

2. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Navigate to: APIs & Services â†’ OAuth consent screen
   - Set **App name**: "16-Bit Weather"
   - **Upload logo**: `/public/logo-16bit-weather.svg` (convert to PNG first)
   - Set **App domain**: `https://www.16bitweather.co`
   - Set **Authorized domains**: `16bitweather.co`, `supabase.co`
   - Save changes

3. **Update OAuth Credentials**
   - Go to: APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
   - Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     ```
     https://cckcvyccjntadoohjntr.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
     https://www.16bitweather.co/auth/callback
     ```

4. **Test the Consent Screen**
   - Try OAuth login again
   - You should now see "16-Bit Weather" with your logo
   - No more raw Supabase URLs!

---

## 3. Deploy to Production (10 minutes)

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication issues

- Add branded logo for OAuth flow
- Fix redirect timeout issues
- Improve callback page UX
- Add OAuth setup documentation"

# Push to main or create PR
git push origin fixed-authentication-issues

# Merge to main and Vercel will auto-deploy
```

### Option B: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the production build locally
npm start

# Deploy using your preferred method
```

---

## 4. Verify Production (5 minutes)

After deploying to production:

### A. Test OAuth Flow
1. Go to: https://www.16bitweather.co/auth/login
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. âœ… Consent screen should show "16-Bit Weather" logo
4. âœ… Should redirect back successfully

### B. Check for Errors
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Complete an OAuth login
3. âœ… No errors in console
4. âœ… Auth state updates immediately

### C. Monitor Analytics
- Check Vercel Analytics for auth success rate
- Monitor error logs for authentication issues
- Watch for any timeout errors

---

## 5. Update Documentation (Optional)

If you made custom changes:

1. Update `docs/CLAUDE.md` with any new patterns
2. Add screenshots of OAuth consent screen to docs
3. Document any additional configuration steps

---

## What Was Fixed?

### Issue 1: OAuth Shows Raw Keys âœ…
- **Before:** Users saw Supabase URLs and technical strings
- **After:** Branded callback page with 16-Bit Weather logo
- **Action Required:** Upload logo to Google Cloud Console (see step 2)

### Issue 2: Users Stuck After Login âœ…
- **Before:** 5-second timeout, users appeared stuck
- **After:** 2-second timeout with fallback redirect
- **Action Required:** None - works automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Logo not showing on callback page

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check that `/public/logo-16bit-weather.svg` exists
- Verify Next.js dev server restarted

### Problem: Still seeing Supabase URLs on consent screen

**Solution:**
- This requires manual configuration in Google Cloud Console
- Follow step 2 above carefully
- May take 1-2 hours for changes to propagate

### Problem: Users still stuck on callback page

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Check that redirect URLs are configured in Supabase Dashboard

### Problem: "Invalid redirect URI" error

**Solution:**
- Add callback URL to Google OAuth allowed redirects
- Format: `https://[PROJECT_ID].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Don't include trailing slash
