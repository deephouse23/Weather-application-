## 🚀 Testing & Rollout

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Non-authenticated preview flow**:

   - Select Tron theme → See countdown timer → Auto-revert to dark

2. **Authenticated full access**:
   - All themes permanently available
   - Theme preferences save automatically
   - No time limits or restrictions

3. **Preview interruption**:
   - If user signs up during preview → Theme becomes permanent
