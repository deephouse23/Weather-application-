# Shadcn Integration Issues - Fixed ✅

## Summary
All critical issues from the smoke test have been resolved. The shadcn integration is now fully functional.

## 1. ✅ FIXED - Toast Duration Bug
**Issue:** Toast duration set to 1,000,000ms (16+ minutes)  
**Solution:**
- Updated `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` from `1000000` to `1000` (1 second) in `use-toast.ts`
- Updated `TOAST_LIMIT` from `1` to `3` to allow multiple toasts
- Standardized all toast service durations to 4 seconds

**Files Modified:**
- `components/ui/use-toast.ts`
- `lib/toast-service.ts`

## 2. ✅ FIXED - Toast Notifications Implemented
**Issue:** Toast system configured but never used  
**Solution:** Added toast notifications for all user actions:

### Weather Search Success:
- Cache hit: `☀️ Weather updated for [city]`
- Fresh API call: `☀️ Weather updated for [city]`

### Weather Search Errors:
- Empty input: `🔍 Please enter a location to search.`
- Short input: `🔍 Please enter at least 3 characters.`
- City not found: `🔍 City not found. Try another location.`
- Connection issues: `📡 Connection issue. Check your internet.`
- General API errors: `⚠️ Unable to fetch weather. Please try again.`

### Rate Limiting:
- Rate exceeded: `⏱️ Too many requests. Please wait a moment.`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Added toastService import and 8+ toast triggers

## 3. ✅ FIXED - Theme Switching Access
**Issue:** Theme switching locked behind authentication  
**Solution:**
- Removed authentication requirement from theme toggle
- Themes now publicly accessible to all users
- Cleaned up unused authentication logic
- Removed lock icon and disabled states

**Files Modified:**
- `components/theme-toggle.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed `isAuthenticated` checks
- Removed `disabled` state
- Removed `SignInPromptModal` import and usage
- Removed `Lock` icon import

## 4. ✅ FIXED - Unused Components Cleanup
**Issue:** 6 unused shadcn components taking up space  
**Solution:** Removed unused components:

**Removed Files:**
- `components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- `components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` 
- `components/ui/select.tsx`
- `components/ui/switch.tsx`
- `components/ui/table.tsx`
- `components/ui/separator.tsx`

**Remaining Active Components:**
- `alert.tsx` ✅ Used for error messages
- `badge.tsx` ✅ Used for status indicators
- `button.tsx` ✅ Used throughout app
- `card.tsx` ✅ Used for weather displays
- `input.tsx` ✅ Used for search fields
- `skeleton.tsx` ✅ Used for loading states
- `tabs.tsx` ✅ Used in dashboard
- `toast.tsx` ✅ Used for notifications
- `toaster.tsx` ✅ Root toast provider
- `toggle-group.tsx` ✅ Internal dependency

- `use-toast.ts` ✅ Toast hook

## Test Results

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Toasts lasted 16+ minutes

- ❌ Theme switching locked for non-authenticated users
- ❌ 6 unused components bloating bundle

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Toasts show for 4 seconds
- ✅ Rich user feedback for all actions
- ✅ Themes accessible to everyone
- ✅ Clean codebase with only used components
- ✅ No build errors related to shadcn

## Performance Impact
