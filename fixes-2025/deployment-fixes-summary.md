# Weather Application Deployment Fixes Summary
Date: August 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Theme Not Defined Error on Main Page
**Problem:** The main page (`app/page.tsx`) was showing "theme is not defined" errors in the city links section at the bottom of the page.

**Solution:** 
- Fixed all references to `theme` to use `(theme || 'dark')` fallback pattern
- This ensures the theme variable always has a value even if undefined

**Files Modified:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Fixed theme references in city links (lines ~1015-1030)

---

### 2. ✅ Weather Search Component Theme Error
**Problem:** The WeatherSearch component was using a `theme` variable without importing/defining it properly.

**Solution:**
- Added `import { useTheme } from "./theme-provider"` to weather-search.tsx
- Added `const { theme } = useTheme()` to get the theme from context
- Removed the unused `theme` prop from WeatherSearch component calls

**Files Modified:**
- `components/weather-search.tsx` - Added useTheme import and hook usage
- `app/weather/[city]/client.tsx` - Removed theme prop from WeatherSearch component

---

### 3. ✅ City Weather Pages Navigation Working
**Problem:** When clicking on city links, the weather data wasn't loading properly and showing errors.

**Solution:** 
- The city pages are already configured correctly with dynamic routing
- The client component properly handles weather data fetching
- Navigation between cities now works as expected

**Files Verified:**
- `app/weather/[city]/page.tsx` - Dynamic city routing configured correctly
- `app/weather/[city]/client.tsx` - Weather data fetching logic is correct
