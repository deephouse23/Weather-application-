# Final Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issues Found
1. **API Key Error (401)**: The environment variable name in Vercel must match what the code expects
2. **Theme undefined error**: Occurring in both main page and city pages during SSR

## CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variable Setup

In your Vercel project settings, you MUST have this EXACT environment variable name:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = your_api_key_here
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The variable name MUST be `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` (not `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` or anything else)

## Code Changes Already Applied

### 1. Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)
✅ Removed broken theme management code
✅ Removed unused currentTheme variable  
✅ Fixed API_KEY definition in handleSearch
✅ Added theme fallbacks (theme || 'dark')
✅ Disabled SSR with dynamic import

### 2. City Pages (`app/weather/[city]/page.tsx`)
✅ Added dynamic import for CityWeatherClient with SSR disabled

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure you have: `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = your_actual_api_key`
   - Remove any duplicate like `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` if it exists

2. **Commit the code changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix SSR issues and API key configuration for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin fix/search-state-improvements
   ```

3. **Trigger Vercel Deployment**:
   - The push will automatically trigger a new build
   - Or manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard

4. **Monitor the build**:
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

## Expected Result
- No more "Geocoding API error: 401" 
- No more "theme is not defined" errors
- Successful build and deployment

## If Build Still Fails

Check that:
1. Environment variable is exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in Vercel
2. The API key value is valid and active
3. All code changes from this fix have been applied

## Note on Google Pollen API
If you see any Google Pollen API errors, you'll also need to set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_POLLEN_API_KEY = your_google_api_key
```
(This is optional - the app will work without it)
